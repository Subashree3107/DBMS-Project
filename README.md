This document outlines the design of an Employee Information Management System, detailing its entities and relationships via an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. The system incorporates user authentication, employee information management, experience tracking, achievement recording, project assignments, salary management, and leave applications, all overseen by managers.
The primary entities in the system include User, Employee, Experience, Achievements, Project, LeaveApplication, SalarySlip, Hike, and Manager. The User entity facilitates authentication through a login system, with additional support for user registration capturing essential user details. The Employee entity captures comprehensive employee information, linking to their professional experiences, achievements, and current projects.
Managers play a crucial role in overseeing various employee-related processes, including salary management through the SalarySlip entity, performance-based increments via the Hike entity, and leave applications through the LeaveApproval entity. This structured management ensures that employees' professional journeys are well-documented and managed efficiently.
The ER diagram effectively illustrates the relationships and interactions between these entities, providing a clear blueprint for implementing a robust and comprehensive Employee Information Management System. This system aims to streamline employee data management, improve administrative efficiency, and enhance the overall employee experience within an organization.
